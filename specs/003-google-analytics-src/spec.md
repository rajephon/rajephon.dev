## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a website owner, I want to optionally enable Google Analytics 4 tracking on my personal website so that I can understand visitor behavior, resume language preferences, and PDF download patterns when I choose to do so, without being forced to always track users.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the site owner has not configured a Google Analytics tracking ID, **When** a visitor accesses any page, **Then** no analytics tracking occurs and no tracking scripts are loaded
2. **Given** the site owner has configured a valid GA4 tracking ID, **When** a visitor accesses any page, **Then** the page view is tracked and sent to Google Analytics 4
3. **Given** GA4 is enabled, **When** a visitor toggles the resume language between Korean and English, **Then** the language toggle event is tracked with the selected language
4. **Given** GA4 is enabled, **When** a visitor downloads the resume PDF, **Then** the PDF download event is tracked with the language version downloaded
5. **Given** an invalid or empty tracking ID is configured, **When** a visitor accesses a page, **Then** no tracking occurs and no errors are displayed to the visitor

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Google Analytics service is unavailable or blocked?
- How does the system handle malformed tracking IDs?
- What occurs if multiple language toggles happen rapidly?
- How are PDF download events handled if the download fails or is cancelled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow optional configuration of a Google Analytics 4 tracking ID in the site configuration
- **FR-002**: System MUST conditionally load Google Analytics 4 tracking scripts only when a tracking ID is configured
- **FR-003**: System MUST track page views automatically when Analytics is enabled
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle missing or invalid tracking IDs gracefully without breaking site functionality
- **FR-005**: System MUST respect user privacy preferences and not track when Analytics is disabled
- **FR-006**: Site owner MUST be able to enable/disable analytics by simply adding or removing the tracking ID from configuration
- **FR-007**: System MUST support Google Analytics 4 (GA4) for tracking
- **FR-008**: System MUST track resume language toggle events (Korean/English switching)
- **FR-009**: System MUST track PDF download events for resume downloads
- **FR-010**: System MUST include the selected language in language toggle events
- **FR-011**: System MUST include the language version in PDF download events

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Analytics Configuration**: Contains optional Google Analytics 4 tracking ID, determines whether analytics tracking is active for the site
- **Language Toggle Event**: User interaction event when switching between Korean and English resume versions
- **PDF Download Event**: User action event when downloading resume PDF files
